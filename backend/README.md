## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or higher (21 is recommended)
- Gradle 7.0+ or use the included Gradle wrapper
- PostgreSQL (for production) or H2 (for development)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-ping-pong-elo.git
   cd java-ping-pong-elo
   ```

2. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

4. **Access the application:**
   The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`

### Database Setup

For development, the application uses H2 database by default with files stored in the `./data` directory.

For production, configure your PostgreSQL database in `application.properties` or through environment variables.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

For secure deployment, configure these environment variables:

```
# Security
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRATION=86400000

# Email
MAIL_HOST=your_smtp_server
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password

# CORS
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourfrontend.com,https://other-allowed-origin.com

# Database (Production)
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://your-db-host:5432/pingpongdb
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=db_username
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=db_password
```

### Elo Curve Configuration

The application uses a custom Elo curve that can be configured in `application.properties`:

```properties
elo.curve.enabled=true
elo.curve.upper-threshold=1600  # Ratings above this receive reduced gains
elo.curve.lower-threshold=800   # Ratings below this receive boosted gains
elo.curve.gain-boost-factor=1.2 # Boost factor for lower-rated players
elo.curve.loss-reduction-factor=0.8 # Reduction factor for lower-rated players
```

## üßÆ How the Elo Rating Works

The application uses a modified Elo rating system specifically tuned for ping pong:

```
New Rating = Old Rating + K √ó Point Factor √ó (Actual Result - Expected Result)
```

Where:
- **K-factor** decreases as players gain experience
- **Point Factor** increases with larger score differentials
- **Actual Result** is 1 for a win, 0 for a loss
- **Expected Result** is calculated based on rating differences

The Elo curve further adjusts rating changes to help newer players catch up while stabilizing ratings for experienced players.
